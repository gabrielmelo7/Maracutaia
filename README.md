# Maracutaia
This is a project that i made for the Federal University of Ceará IEEE Student Branch selective process. It´s meant to pair people up based on their personality. The name "Maracutaia" is a portuguese word for "shady business". It´s an inside joke tho, don´t take the name too seriously lol.
The code is kind of rough and trashy, i intend to work more on it. But, as of now, it works. So it´s okay.
